# Interested in joining the TODO Group?

[TODO Group Community](https://todogroup.org/community/) is open to all. Sometimes, there are community participants with an established OSPO or open source initiative who wish to become a General Member.

Every TODO Group General Member must agree and sign the [charter](https://github.com/todogroup/charter).

If you're interested in joining and support TODO as General Member, please complete the [membership application](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=todogroup).

*Note: To be a TODO Group General Member, you must be a [Linux Foundation member](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/members/join).*
