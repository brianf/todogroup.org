The TODO Group is happy to announce the fourth annual Open Source Program Management Survey results that examines the prevalence 
and outcomes of open source programs, including the key benefits and barriers to adoption. We have open sourced all of our survey 
results, raw data and graphics: https://github.com/todogroup/survey/tree/master/2022.

## Key Findings

* Adoption of OSPOs or similar programs has risen to 50%, the highest level in 5 years. (Slide 11)
* 65% of organizations that frequently contribute code upstream have a formally
structured OSPO. (Slide 12)
* Formal policies about contributing to non-upstream projects exist at 58% of organizations that frequently contribute code upstream. (Slide 14)
* More than ever, success is measured by the volume of contributions and contributors coming from outside the organization. (Slide 28)
* 49% of Asia-Pacific-headquartered organizations without an OSPO cite time and
resource constraints as a reason why. (Slide 38)
* Organizations that maintain the most projects are leading the charge to require
DCOs. (Slide 50)
